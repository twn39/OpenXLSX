# OpenXLSX

[![OpenXLSX CI](https://github.com/twn39/OpenXLSX/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/twn39/OpenXLSX/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

OpenXLSX is a high-performance C++ library for reading, writing, creating, and modifying Microsoft Excel® files in the `.xlsx` format. It is designed to be fast, cross-platform, and has minimal external dependencies.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Modern C++**: Built with C++17, ensuring type safety and modern abstractions.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for speed, capable of processing millions of cells per second.
- **Zero-Dependency Core**: All dependencies (`libzip`, `pugixml`, `fmt`, `fast_float`) are integrated via CMake's `FetchContent` or standard library.
- **Unicode Support**: Consistent UTF-8 handling across all platforms using C++17 `std::filesystem`.
- **Comprehensive Image Support**: Insert and read images (PNG/JPEG) with automatic dimension detection and aspect ratio preservation.
- **Rich Text & Formatting**: Support for multi-format text segments (`XLRichText`), fonts, fills, borders, and conditional formatting.
- **Advanced Data Validation**: Enterprise-grade data validation API with smart range collapsing, complex region subtraction, cross-sheet reference safety, and ergonomic configuration objects (`XLDataValidationConfig`).
- **Data Tables & AutoFilters**: High-level API for creating and managing Excel Tables (`XLTables`), including totals rows, column-level aggregate functions (`Sum`, `Average`, etc.), and custom logical AutoFilters.
- **AutoFilter & Names**: Set worksheet filters and manage workbook-level named ranges and constants.
- **Page Setup & Print**: Fine-grained control over margins, orientation, paper size, and print options (gridlines, headings, centering).
- **Sheet Protection**: Secure worksheets with passwords and granular permission controls.
- **Enhanced DateTime**: Robust date/time handling with `std::chrono` integration and string parsing/formatting.
- **Worksheet Management**: Create, clone, rename, and delete worksheets with validation.
- **Data Integrity**: Enforces OOXML standards, including strict XML declarations and metadata handling.
- **Modern Testing**: Integrated with **Catch2 v3.13.0** for robust verification.

## 🛠 Quick Start

```cpp
#include <OpenXLSX.hpp>
#include <iostream>

using namespace OpenXLSX;

int main() {
    XLDocument doc;
    doc.create("Example.xlsx", XLForceOverwrite);
    auto wks = doc.workbook().worksheet("Sheet1");

    // Writing data
    wks.cell("A1").value() = "Hello, OpenXLSX!";
    wks.cell("B1").value() = 42;

    doc.save();
    return 0;
}
```

### 📊 Advanced Feature: Data Tables & AutoFilters

```cpp
#include <OpenXLSX.hpp>
#include <iostream>

using namespace OpenXLSX;

int main() {
    XLDocument doc;
    doc.create("SalesTable.xlsx", XLForceOverwrite);
    auto wks = doc.workbook().worksheet("Sheet1");

    // 1. Prepare data (Headers + 3 rows)
    wks.cell("B2").value() = "Product";
    wks.cell("C2").value() = "Sales";
    wks.cell("B3").value() = "Apples";  wks.cell("C3").value() = 5000;
    wks.cell("B4").value() = "Oranges"; wks.cell("C4").value() = 4200;
    wks.cell("B5").value() = "Bananas"; wks.cell("C5").value() = 7500;

    // 2. Create a Table and snap it to the data
    auto& table = wks.tables();
    table.setName("SalesTable");
    table.resizeToFitData(wks); // Automatically detects B2:C5
    
    // 3. Enable Totals Row and expand range (B2:C6)
    table.setRangeReference("B2:C6"); 
    table.setShowTotalsRow(true);
    table.setStyleName("TableStyleMedium9");

    // 4. Configure Column-level Aggregate Functions
    auto col1 = table.appendColumn("Product");
    col1.setTotalsRowLabel("Total:");
    wks.cell("B6").value() = "Total:";

    auto col2 = table.appendColumn("Sales");
    col2.setTotalsRowFunction(XLTotalsRowFunction::Sum);
    // Use SUBTOTAL formula for dynamic updates when filtering
    wks.cell("C6").formula() = "SUBTOTAL(109,SalesTable[Sales])";

    // 5. Apply a Custom AutoFilter (Sales > 4500)
    auto filter = table.autoFilter();
    filter.filterColumn(1).setCustomFilter("greaterThan", "4500");

    doc.save();
    return 0;
}
```

## 📦 Installation & Build

OpenXLSX uses a simplified CMake (3.15+) build system.

### Integration (FetchContent)
The recommended way to use OpenXLSX is via CMake's `FetchContent`:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(
  OpenXLSX
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/twn39/OpenXLSX.git
  GIT_TAG        master # Or a specific tag
)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(OpenXLSX)
target_link_libraries(my_project PRIVATE OpenXLSX::OpenXLSX)
```

### Manual Build
To build the library and tests locally:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . -j8
```

## 🧪 Testing
The library features a comprehensive test suite. To run the tests after building:
```bash
# From the build directory
./OpenXLSXTests
```

## ⚠️ Development Conventions

### Unicode / UTF-8
**All string input and output must be in UTF-8 encoding.** OpenXLSX uses `std::filesystem` to handle cross-platform path conversion (including UTF-8 on Windows). Ensure your source files are saved in UTF-8.

### Indexing
- **Sheet Indexing**: 1-based (consistent with Excel).
- **Row/Column Indexing**: Generally 1-based where it follows Excel conventions.

### Performance & Optimizations
The build system includes platform-specific optimizations for `Release` builds (e.g., `/O2` on MSVC, `-O3` on GCC/Clang) and supports **LTO (Link-Time Optimization)** which can be toggled via `OPENXLSX_ENABLE_LTO`.

<summary><b>Detailed Change Log</b></summary>

### 2026-03-18: Enhanced Data Tables & AutoFilter
- **Table High-level API**: Implemented a comprehensive `XLTables` interface for creating and managing Excel Tables.
- **Totals Row Support**: Added support for `showTotalsRow`, `totalsRowCount`, and column-level aggregate functions (`Sum`, `Average`, `Count`, etc.) via `XLTableColumn`.
- **Advanced AutoFilters**: Enhanced `XLAutoFilter` to support custom logical rules (e.g., `greaterThan`) and value-based filtering.
- **Ergonomic Resizing**: Added `resizeToFitData()` to automatically snap table boundaries to contiguous worksheet data.
- **OOXML Compliance Fixes**: Standardized boolean XML attributes to `1`/`0` and optimized node ordering to ensure 100% compatibility with MS Excel's strict validation.
- **Performance & Testing**: Added comprehensive Catch2 unit tests and OOXML structure verification tests.

### 2026-03-16: Architectural Migration & Privacy Cleanup
- **Modernized File Creation**: Completely abandoned the hardcoded, 7.7KB hex-encoded binary `.xlsx` template. Migrated to dynamic, `constexpr std::string_view` XML string templates (inspired by Excelize), significantly improving code readability and maintainability without sacrificing C++ performance.
- **Privacy & Metadata Scrubbing**: Removed legacy workaround code that was previously necessary to scrub the original author's local file paths and revision histories embedded within the old binary payload. The new XML templates guarantee a 100% clean and pristine initial state for all generated documents.
- **Zip Archive Reliability**: Fixed a bug where files dynamically injected into memory during creation were occasionally discarded upon `save()` due to missing internal modification flags in `XLZipArchive`.
- **Enhanced Validation Compliance**: Embedded strict MS Excel required namespaces and `xl/theme/theme1.xml` to prevent any "file corruption / recovery" warnings when opening programmatically generated files.

### 2026-03-15: Feature Expansion & Robustness
- **Implemented Rich Text**: Added `XLRichText` and `XLRichTextRun` for multi-format text segments within cells, including support for font colors and styles.
- **AutoFilter Support**: New API to set and manage worksheet filters.
- **Workbook Defined Names**: Implemented `XLDefinedNames` for managing global and local named ranges.
- **Page Setup & Print Options**: Added comprehensive control over margins, orientation, paper size, and print-specific settings.
- **Granular Sheet Protection**: Enhanced protection with granular control over user permissions (sorting, formatting, filtering).
- **DateTime Overhaul**: Enhanced `XLDateTime` with `std::chrono` support, `fromString`/`toString` methods, and a convenient `now()` function.
- **Internal OOXML Verification**: Migrated structure verification tests to use internal APIs, removing external dependencies like `unzip` for testing.
- **Stability Fixes**: Resolved potential segmentation faults in protection property access and fixed symbol conflicts in test builds.

### 2026-03-14: Dependency Cleanup & Data Integrity
- **Removed `nowide` Dependency**: Migrated to C++17 `std::filesystem::u8path` for cross-platform UTF-8 path support, reducing the library footprint and simplifying build logic.
- **Fixed Document Properties**: Resolved issues where Title, Subject, and Creator were not correctly updated in `core.xml` due to OOXML namespace handling.
- **XML Format Optimization**: Switched to standard XML formatting to ensure XML declarations are preserved, improving compatibility with Excel and other spreadsheet viewers.
- **CI Enhancement**: Added caching for dependencies in GitHub Actions to speed up build times.

### 2026-02-28: Major Refactor & Feature Update
- **Unified Build System**: Consolidated all sub-module CMake configurations into a single root `CMakeLists.txt`.
- **Optimization Suite**: Added LTO support and platform-specific Release optimizations (`/O2`, `-O3`, dead-code stripping).
- **Image Support**: Implemented `XLDrawing` and aspect-ratio aware image insertion.
- **Data Validation**: Enhanced data validation support with full CRUD operations and Excel-compliant XML serialization.
- **Enhanced Testing**: Merged test suite into main build flow with automatic test data handling.
